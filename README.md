## Introduction ##
This repository provides solution to the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Michael-T-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)

I have always been fascinated by data structures & algorithms and consider them an important tool in "repository" of a software engineer.

Even though I am predominately a PHP developer, The choice of python language was easy because it provides minimal lines of code for problem-solving and is widely used mainly due to its easily understandable syntax.

The core part of book start from chapter 4 (Recursion), so i am posting solutions from thereafter.
I have divided solutions into 3 parts Reinforcement, Creativity and Projects (similar to book's exercises)

Feel free to read, post issues and PRs for this repository.
